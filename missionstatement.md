The League of Science Superfriends is a coalition of scientists, clinicians and health care professionals that are passionate about communicating to the public around the latest developments in basic, translational and clinical scientific research. As our respective training programs were funded by taxpayer funding, our team believes in our obligation to return this investment by society through actively addressing questions from the public around science and medicine.
