The League of Science Superfriends are (in alphabetical order):

### Dr. Julie Crudele

Dr. Julie Crudele has a Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in Gene Therapy and Vaccines. She is now an Acting Assistant Professor at the University of Washington, where she has started her own lab to study immune responses to gene therapy and viral vectors. Throughout her scientific career, Dr. Crudele has focused on the interplay between the immune system and foreign proteins in the context of treating human disease. She is also an outspoken advocate for vaccines and takes every chance she's given to sing the praises of the HPV vaccines (go get one today!). 

### Dr. Thea Golden

### Dr. Sigrid Gouma

I obtained my PhD degree from Erasmus University Rotterdam (The Netherlands) in 2016. Since 2017, I work as a postdoctoral researcher in Scott Hensleyâ€™s lab at the University of Pennsylvania, where I study antibody responses to seasonal H3N2 influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2. One study I am involved in looks into SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in blood samples collected from pregnant women who present to the hospital for delivery and cord blood samples from their newborns. These samples enable us to study factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Philadelphia over time as well as transfer of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies across the placenta.

### Dr. Leticia Kuri-Cervantes

Dr. Leticia Kuri-Cervantes is originally from Mexico City. She has a bachelors degree in Biology, followed by a Masters Degree in Immunology at Imperial College London, and a PhD in Biosciences at UNAM in Mexico. She is now a Senior Scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. 
She decided to go into the Biology field at the age of thirteen with the hope to cure HIV/AIDS. She started her training on infectious diseases working with tuberculosis, followed by over 12 years of ongoing research on HIV/AIDS immunopathology. Her ample experience in biosafety landed her the responsibility of processing the first SARS-CoV2 samples collected at UPenn, contributed to the training of the staff now in charge of handling all COVID-19-related samples and has shifted her research to a new scope in infectious diseases.
She has been involved in teaching and is very outspoken about infectious diseases, both HIV/AIDS and COVID-19, particularly towards the Latin-American community.  

### Dr. Peter Morawski

Dr. Peter Morawski received his Ph.D. in Immunology from the University of Pennsylvania in 2013. He is now a Staff Scientist at the Benaroya Research Institute in Seattle where he studies how T cells and non-immune cells in human skin cooperate to regulate immunity and wound healing in health and disease. Throughout his scientific career, Dr. Morawski's primary focus has been on the study of autoimmune disease, being most interested to understand what happens in the body when the immune system mistakenly attacks our own tissue. Since the start of the pandemic, Dr. Morawski has been researching the human immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 vaccines, and was among the first to demonstrate that people can form lasting immune memory after recovering from COVID-19. In March of 2020 he went to Capitol Hill with the American Association of Immunologists to advocate for medical research funding, meeting with members of Congress to discuss the critical role for scientific research in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Dr. Jillian Whidby

Jillian's passion for virology began as an undergraduate studying adenoviruses. From there, she spent 2 years working in a Penn laboratory that studied HIV, Rift Valley fever, West Nile virus, Andes virus, and Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever virus (to name a few).  She completed her PhD from Rutgers in 2012, where she conducted extensive biochemical and biophysical experiments toward treatment and vaccine design for hepatitis C virus, the same type of structural biology work that was used to design the mRNA vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. She left the lab to become a Medical Writer and now prepares work for clinical trials in rare diseases. She is also Mom to a 7 year old girl who is equally passionate about science and health.
